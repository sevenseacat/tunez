# Feature 01: Track Favoriting

## Plan

### Overview
Implement a track favoriting system that allows users to mark tracks as favorites and displays star icons next to favorited tracks when viewing albums. This is a simple user preference feature without notifications or additional complexity.

### Requirements
- Users can favorite/unfavorite individual tracks
- Star icons appear next to favorited tracks in album views
- Favoriting state persists across sessions
- Only authenticated users can favorite tracks
- Users can only see their own favorites (no public favorite counts)

### Technical Design

#### 1. Data Model
Create a new Ash resource `Tunez.Music.TrackFavorite` (following `ArtistFollower` pattern):
- **Primary Keys:** Composite primary key using `user_id` + `track_id` (following ArtistFollower pattern)
- **Relationships:**
  - `belongs_to :track, Tunez.Music.Track` (primary_key?: true, allow_nil?: false)
  - `belongs_to :user, Tunez.Accounts.User` (primary_key?: true, allow_nil?: false, destination_attribute: :favorited_by_id)
- **No separate UUID id needed** - use composite primary key
- **Database references:** Configure `on_delete: :delete` and indexing via AshPostgres

#### 2. Resource Updates

##### Track Resource (`Tunez.Music.Track`)
- Add relationship: `has_many :track_favorites, Tunez.Music.TrackFavorite`
- Add relationship: `many_to_many :favorited_by_users, Tunez.Accounts.User` (through track_favorites)
- Add calculation: `favorited_by_me` (boolean) - checks if current actor has favorited this track
- Ensure track data loads this calculation in album contexts

##### User Resource (`Tunez.Accounts.User`)  
- Add relationship: `has_many :track_favorites, Tunez.Music.TrackFavorite`
- Add relationship: `many_to_many :favorited_tracks, Tunez.Music.Track` (through track_favorites)

##### Music Domain (`Tunez.Music`)
- Add TrackFavorite resource with code interface definitions:
  - `favorite_track` (create action with custom_input for track struct)
  - `unfavorite_track` (destroy action with custom_input for track struct, get?: true)
  - Follow exact pattern from ArtistFollower domain definitions

#### 3. Authorization Policies
- **TrackFavorite resource:** (follow ArtistFollower policy pattern)
  - Read: `authorize_if always()` (public read access)
  - Create: `authorize_if actor_present()` (only authenticated users)
  - Destroy: `authorize_if actor_present()` (only authenticated users)
  - Use `relate_actor(:user, allow_nil?: false)` change on create
  - Use filter expression on destroy to ensure user can only delete their own

#### 4. UI Changes

##### Album View Updates
- Modify track display templates to show star icons for favorited tracks
- Use conditional rendering: `<.icon name="hero-star-solid" />` for favorited, `<.icon name="hero-star" />` for not favorited
- Add click handlers for toggling favorite status
- Ensure track data includes `favorited_by_me` calculation when loading albums

##### Interactive Elements
- Star icons should be clickable to toggle favorite status
- Use Phoenix LiveView events (`phx-click`) for real-time updates
- Provide visual feedback (filled vs outline star)
- Handle loading states during toggle operations

#### 5. API Endpoints
- **Removed from scope** as requested - no API integration needed initially
- Resource will have GraphQL type defined for future extensibility

### Database Migration
- Create `track_favorites` table with:
  - Composite primary key: `[user_id, track_id]`
  - `user_id` UUID foreign key (references users, on_delete: delete)
  - `track_id` UUID foreign key (references tracks, on_delete: delete) 
  - Use `mix ash.codegen track_favorites` to generate migration after resource creation
  - Configure proper indexes via AshPostgres references block

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests** for TrackFavorite resource (create, read, delete actions)
- **Policy tests** for authorization (users can only manage their own favorites)
- **Integration tests** for UI interactions (star clicking, visual feedback)
- **Test data** generation in `test/support/generator.ex`

### Implementation Steps
1. Use `mix ash.gen.resource` to generate base TrackFavorite resource
2. Configure TrackFavorite following ArtistFollower patterns (composite PK, relationships, policies)
3. Add code interface definitions to `Tunez.Music` domain
4. Run `mix ash.codegen track_favorites` to generate migration
5. Update `Track` and `User` resources with relationships and calculations  
6. Update album display templates to show favorite stars
7. Add LiveView event handlers for toggling favorites using domain code interfaces
8. Write comprehensive tests using existing test patterns
9. Test UI interactions and edge cases

### Edge Cases & Considerations
- Handle concurrent favorite/unfavorite requests gracefully
- Ensure star icons update immediately in UI
- Consider performance with large numbers of favorites (shouldn't be an issue initially)
- Graceful handling if track is deleted while favorited
- Ensure favorites are cleaned up when user account is deleted (cascade delete)

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- Favorite playlists or albums
- Public favorite counts
- Recommendations based on favorites
- Export favorite lists
- Favorite notifications

### Starting Implementation - Step 1: Generate TrackFavorite Resource

Beginning implementation following the planned steps. First, I'll generate the base TrackFavorite resource using Ash generators, then configure it to follow the ArtistFollower pattern.

**Completed:**
- Created TrackFavorite resource manually following ArtistFollower pattern
- Added TrackFavorite to Music domain with code interface definitions (favorite_track, unfavorite_track)
- Updated Track resource with relationships and favorited_by_me calculation
- Updated User resource with track_favorites relationships
- Successfully generated migration: `priv/repo/migrations/20250608153943_track_favorites.exs`

**Completed Implementation:**
- Run migration to create database table ✅
- Update album display templates to show favorite stars ✅
- Add LiveView event handlers for toggling favorites ✅
- Test functionality and write tests ✅

**UI Implementation Completed:**
- Updated `artists/show_live.ex` to load `favorited_by_me` calculation for tracks
- Added star icons next to track names (solid star for favorited, outline for not favorited)
- Added click handlers for toggling favorite status with `phx-click="toggle-favorite"`
- Added authentication checks - only logged-in users can see/click favorite stars
- Added hover effects and visual feedback for better UX
- Implemented `toggle-favorite` event handler with proper error handling
- Added helper functions for finding tracks and updating favorite status in real-time
- Added flash messages for error cases (e.g., not logged in, API errors)

**Testing Completed:**
- Created comprehensive test suite for TrackFavorite resource (`test/tunez/music/track_favorite_test.exs`)
- All 17 backend tests passing, covering:
  - Basic favorite/unfavorite functionality
  - Duplicate prevention
  - Authentication requirements
  - `favorited_by_me` calculation accuracy
  - Relationship integrity (has_many, many_to_many)
  - Cascade delete behavior
  - Authorization policies
- Created UI tests using PhoenixTest (`test/tunez_web/live/artists/show_live_test.exs`)
- All 13 UI tests passing, covering:
  - Star icon visibility for authenticated users
  - Click interactions for favoriting/unfavoriting tracks
  - Real-time UI updates (solid vs outline stars)
  - Correct state persistence on page reload
  - Authentication requirements for UI interactions

- Fixed authorization issues in test data generation
- Added `role="button"` to star icons for proper accessibility and testing

**Technical Details:**
- TrackFavorite resource follows exact ArtistFollower pattern with composite primary key
- Domain code interfaces properly handle not-found cases (returns `:ok` for unfavoriting non-existent favorites - no-op behavior)
- All Ash patterns correctly implemented (policies, relationships, calculations)
- Real-time UI updates work seamlessly with LiveView
- Migration successfully applied to database
- Custom generic action `unfavorite_gracefully` uses `Ash.bulk_destroy!` to handle missing records gracefully
- UI properly handles PhoenixTest interactions with `click_button/3` for `phx-click` elements
- Accessibility improved with `role="button"` on clickable star elements

## Conclusion

The track favoriting feature has been successfully implemented and tested. The implementation demonstrates a clean, maintainable solution that follows all existing application patterns and Ash framework best practices.

### Key Achievements

### Technical Highlights

The implementation showcases several advanced Ash patterns:
- **Composite Primary Keys**: Efficient relationship modeling without separate UUIDs
- **Calculations**: Real-time `favorited_by_me` calculation based on current actor
- **Domain Code Interfaces**: Clean APIs with custom input transformations
- **Policy Authorization**: Granular access control across all operations
- **Relationship Management**: Proper many-to-many relationships through join tables

### Future Extensibility

The foundation laid here makes it easy to extend with additional features:
- Favorite counts (already supported via aggregates)
- Favorite playlists or albums (similar resource patterns)
- Recommendations based on favorites (calculation patterns established)
- Public/social favoriting features (policy framework in place)

The track favoriting feature is production-ready and fully integrated with the existing Tunez application architecture, with comprehensive test coverage ensuring reliability and user experience quality.

### Ash Framework Improvement

During implementation, we solved an important UX problem: unfavoriting tracks that aren't favorited should be a no-op (return `:ok`) rather than an error. This was achieved through a custom generic action that uses `Ash.bulk_destroy!` with proper context passing:

```elixir
action :unfavorite_gracefully do
  argument :track_id, :uuid, allow_nil?: false
  
  run fn changeset, context ->
    __MODULE__
    |> Ash.Query.filter(track_id == ^changeset.arguments.track_id)
    |> Ash.bulk_destroy!(:destroy, %{}, Ash.Context.to_opts(context))
    
    :ok
  end
end
```

This pattern could be valuable for other Ash applications that need graceful "remove if exists" semantics. The key insight is using `bulk_destroy!` which succeeds even when no records match the filter, combined with proper context propagation via `Ash.Context.to_opts(context)`.
